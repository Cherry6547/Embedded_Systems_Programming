# 🔘 Blinky – GPIO Toggle (STM32F446RE)

This is a basic bare-metal program that toggles the onboard LED (PA5) on the STM32 Nucleo-F446RE board.

---

## 🧠 What the Code Does

- Enables the clock for GPIOA via `RCC_AHB1ENR`.
- Sets pin PA5 as a general-purpose output using `GPIOA_MODER`.
- Toggles the output using `GPIOA_ODR` inside an infinite loop.
- A simple delay loop is used to slow down the toggling.

---

## ⚙️ Registers Used

- `RCC_AHB1ENR` – Enables GPIOA peripheral clock.
- `GPIOA_MODER` – Configures PA5 as output.
- `GPIOA_ODR` – Toggles PA5 state.

## 📦 Project Notes

- This project uses:
  - **Startup files** (default from STM32CubeIDE)
  - **Linker script** (generated by the IDE)
  - **Dummy syscall stubs** (`_sbrk`, `_write`, etc.) to satisfy linker dependencies
- All core logic is written manually using **bare-metal register access** (no HAL or CubeMX used).

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Open the project in STM32CubeIDE.
2. Flash it to your Nucleo-F446RE board.
3. Watch the onboard green LED (PA5) blink.
