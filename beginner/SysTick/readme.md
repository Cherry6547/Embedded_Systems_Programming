# ‚è±Ô∏è SysTick-Based Delay Blinky ‚Äì STM32F446RE

This project toggles the onboard LED (PA5) with a precise 1-second delay using the **Cortex-M4 SysTick timer**.

---

## üß† What the Code Does

- Sets PA5 as a GPIO output.
- Uses the **SysTick timer** to implement a millisecond delay.
- Toggles the LED with a 1000 ms (1 second) interval.

---

## üß∞ Registers Used

- `RCC_AHB1ENR` ‚Äì Enables GPIOA clock
- `GPIOA_MODER` ‚Äì Configures PA5 as output
- `GPIOA_ODR` ‚Äì Toggles the LED
- `STK_CTRL`, `STK_LOAD`, `STK_VAL` ‚Äì Used to configure and control the SysTick timer

---

## üì¶ Notes

- SysTick runs at **16 MHz** core clock ‚Üí 16000 ticks = 1 ms
- The project uses **bare-metal code only**
- **Startup files**, **linker script**, and **syscalls** are from STM32CubeIDE template

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. Flash the code to your Nucleo-F446RE.
2. Observe the onboard LED (PA5) blinking every second.
